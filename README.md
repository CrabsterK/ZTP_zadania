# ZTP – Advanced Programming Techniques
Repository created to store tasks which I am solving for classes.


## ZTP_zadanie0 - CRUD
Implementation of C(reate)R(etrive)U(update)D(elete) operations. Data is stored in MySQL database using JDBC.
Project created as MVP – Minumum Viable Product, as starting task for laboratories.


## ZTP_zadanie1 – Polymorphism
Program combines all types of polymorphisms:
- Subtyping / inclusion polymorphism
- Ad hoc polymorphism
	- Coercion
	- Overloading
- Parametric polymorphism


## ZTP_zadanie1.2 - Reflection
The task was to use reflection mechanism to create instances of generic objects and array of ganeric objects. It was also necessary to implement colne method for any generic type.


## ZTP_zadanie2.1 - Optimalization
The task was to test optimization techniques from C# in Java: 
  - using arrays instead of collections
  - using variables with small range instead of long range values


## ZTP_zadanie2.2 - Design Patterns
Task is implemented witch use of two designs patterns:
  - Prototype
  - Decorator
  
  
## ZTP_zadanie3.1 - Java8 idioms
Task was to use java8 stream() with:
  - filter()
  - map()
  - max/min
  - collect()
  
  
  ## ZTP_zadanie3.2 - SQL migration
Simple transcription form short forms to SQL taska, as described in BNF.
There were used Exception Handling as saving logs, alternative functions, lists of choice.


  ## ZTP_zadanie4.1 - Visitor
Using Visitor pattern on AST tree to show data like XLM file.


  ## ZTP_zadanie5.2 - Metrics
Analysing metrics to find code smells, improve code and check metrics changes.


  ## ZTP_zadanie6.1 - Thread
Garage traffic implementation using threads for vehicles.
